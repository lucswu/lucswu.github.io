so turns out that i missed a line of "---" that ended up killing the entire /blog page and prevented github from rendering my site
i had to go and look around and considering that i don't actually know any html i think that i did pretty well and found the error pretty quick.
not that anyone will read this anyway :') but it is a fun place to put my own thoughts that are private but not at the same time.
that's a pretty fun twist, isn't it?
