It's been a good six months since I've touched this site.
Perhaps I'll add some things and work on some more html stuff.
I've added a new tab "Projects" that I have yet to complete, but I hope to put stuff that I'm working on, from this site to the Primer for Mathematical Finance and my internship at Bond Intelligence, on there.
